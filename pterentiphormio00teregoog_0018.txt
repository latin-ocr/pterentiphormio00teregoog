but at any rate the division into the old and the newis an im-
portant one, and each of these two classes is marked by well-
defined characteristica

The new comedy, in its development, coincides with the

political decline of Graece and with the gradual decay of her ,

art. As compared with the old comedy, it shows in many rc-
pects unmistakable retrogression. As a natural result, how·
wer, of the conditions already indicated, it is free from that
distinctly local coloring, which makes even a play of Aris·
tophanes often unintelligible to one whcis not familiar with the
condition of affairs in Athens at the time the play was written3
it has the cosmopolitan character, which becomes, during the
fourth and third centuries before Christ, more and more
peculiar to Greek life. lt was owing to this peculiar cosmo-
politan character that the new comedy, about the middle of the
third century before Christ, found a welcome in Rome —a city
highly developed politically‚ but as yet without a literature.
That the comic poets of Rome chose the material for their

translations and adaptations exclusively from the new (and the
socalled middle) comedy, isnot then due wholly to the fact that
that kind of writing was still flcurishiug when Roman litera
tnre began.

Roman comedy.

, The ancient Romans, like the ltalians of today, had, as one

of their notable characteristica, a fondness for the dramatic,
and especially for the comic. Vergil, in Georg. Π. 385-396 (cf.
Hor. Ep. ΙΙ. 1, 139 a), picturas the gaieties of rural festivals,
at which improvised jests, in rude verse, were erchanged in
animated dialogus. These versus Fescennini, as they are
commonly called (after the town of Fesoennia), had no liter·
ary importancc; but still we see in‘ them germs similar tc
those from which the Greeks developed their artistic comedy,
Itis interesting also tc note that a process of development
seems to have set in on Roman, much as it did on Greek,
