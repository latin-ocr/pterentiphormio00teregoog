· find that all the plays 01 Plautus hear Latin titles (Asinaria,
Aulularia, Captivi, sta), except in plays like the Amphitruo
and the Epidicus, where the title is taken 11011 the Greek
name 01 a person in the play. The plays 01 Plautus too,
abeund in Roman allusione, although the general coloring,
even in Plautus, is 01 course distinctly Greek. Later, however,
as the influence oi Greek culture carne to be more widespread,
there was an ever-increasing tendency tc make the Latin plays
more nearly like the Greek 11011 which the plots were taken.
Indeed, the contemporaries 01 Terence, among them his chief
adversary‚ Luscius Lanuvinus, made it a point 01 attack that
he departed so iar 11011 his Greek original, as to weave 1110
the general plot 01 his drama such scenes from other Greek
comedies as particularly¹ struck his lancy. This was done in
the case of the Andria, the Adelphos, and the Eunuchus3 per·
haps also in the Hecyra (Rh. Mus. XXI. 80 1.). This process
01 combining parts 01 different plays into one was maliciously
called contaminatio. Except in this one respect, Terence has
followed his Greek originals very closely, and the Roman allu-
sicns, which are so common in Plautus, are almost entirely
wanting in Terence. The taunts 01 his cnemies regarding his
habit 01 combining parts of two plays into ons had no effect
upon him, except that he was led repeatedly to justiiy the
practice in the prologues 01 his plays (01. Andr. Prol. 13-21,
Heaut. Prol. 16-21, Ad. Prol. 1-14, Eun. Prol. 31-33).

There was still another point with reference 10 the subject-
matter 01 a play which the critics 01 that time considered
important, viz. that plays must be entirely new, ie. the Greek
original was tc be one that had not been reproduced, either as
awhole, or in part, by any other Latin poet, and so one that
was entirely unknown to the spectatores This requirement

1 This principle is stated in a humorous connection in Plaut. Pseud.

inuentam adferre addecet. St id facere nequeat, det locam tlla' qut
