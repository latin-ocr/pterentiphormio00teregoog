Among the Greeks, the number oi actors allowed upon the
stage at any one time was limited. This was nottho case
among the Romans, as there could be any number oi actore
which convenience might dictate. The dominus yreyis did not,
oi course, care to increase the number unnecessarily, on account
oi the additional expense, preferring rather to produce a play
with a few superior aotors than with a larger number oi in·
different ones. The Latin fabula palliata resembled the later
periodos the new Greek comedy in having no chorus. In ex·
ceptional cases, there seems to have been something similar to
it probably in imitation oi the Greek original, ey. the chorus
of fishermen in Plaut. Rud. (vs. 290 ff.); but this was placed,
not in the orchestra, but upon the stage. There is nothing oi
the kind, however, in Terence.

Temale characters were, until comparatively late times (ci.
Donatus on And. IV. 3,1), impersonated by male actore in
female dress. An exception to this rule must, however, be
made in the case oi the mimas (minzi), in which the female
parts were really taken by women. It is needless to say that
these women, like all the other actors in mimos, were in very
bad repute.

The custom oi using masks seems ιο have been introduced
soon after Terence bytho theatrical managers, Cincius Faliscus
and Minucius Prothymus. Up to that time actors depended
for their effecte upon wigs and rouge.

The plot in the sabula palliata is invariably laid in a Greek
town or colony, usually in Athens. When the action was
supposed to be taking place in a town, the proscenium repre·
