About certain details 01 the diagram above given there is oppor-
tunity ior differences 01 opinion, but, in a general way, it rep-
resents fairly well the views now prevailing. 1 have followed
Prinahom, Dziatzko, Schlee, and others, in making DG represent
an older family than ΡΟ. Pease, however, in a paper on the Rela-
tive Value 01 the Manuscripts 01 Terence (Transactions 01 the
American Philological Association, 1887), has proved conclusively
thatP is iar more trustworthy than any other Ma.,-with the ex-
ception 01 Α. It is extremely probable, too, that the picturas in
Per (see note on dramatis personae) have come from a Ms. 01 the
best period (Leo, Rh. Mus. xxxviii3 Schlee‚ Scholia Terentiana3 et
ab), though it seems equally probable that the text 01 Por has
not been materially influenced by this early Ms. 3 see‚for instance,
Schlee‚ pp. 61. For the literature that has appeared on this snb-
ject since the publication 01 Dziatzko’s edition, see the end 01 this

volume.
DIDAscALIA.

liliive: Dziatzko reads ΗΑΤΙ1Ι118. The initialHrests solely upon
the authority 01 A in the didascalice 01 the Eunuchus and 01 the
Adelphos, and upon the mark preceding the name in B (1ΑΠΙ1Ι118)
and in C (llnrlllvs) in the didascalia 01 the Eunuchus.1 No
weight whatever, in my opinion, ia to be attached to this evi-
dence. The scribe 01 A resembled the Arrius 01 Catullus (83, 2),
10 having a decided fondness ior an initial a (which he writes K ).
In no less than 17 places, he uses h where it dces not belong= bis
