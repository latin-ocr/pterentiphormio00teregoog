even in a causal 01 adversative sense, is regularly ln Plautus, and
commonly in Terence, construed with the indicative. The subjunc-
tive constructione represent a comparatively late growth‚ due to the
influence of the subjunctive qui-clauses, quom itseli being arelative
(irom the same root ae qai) with some form ci tempus understood
as its antecedent. We should here expect the subjunctive oi in-
direct discourse, but the speaker prefers to keep his own point oi
view in the quom-clause. Stare, ln the sense oi succeed, aa opposed
to cadere (Hor. Ep. 11, 1,176)‚ extpt(Hec.15),andloco moueri (32),
was first used oi an actor who pleased the audience and so was
allowed to romain upon the stage (ci. Hec. 36), then oi the poet (Hor.
Satl, 10, 17), and oi the drama itseli‚ as here and And. 27, Hec.

12-21. The whole burden oi the prologues oi Terence consiste
oi answers to the unkind criticisms he received irorn his enemies.
The prologues oi Plautus, on the other hand, show a great variety
oi subiect matter and commonly explain the plot oi the play.

13. laceselseet: perfecte in cni, -cct‘, -001, -t'ct', oiten drop the
0 beiore er, ist, or iss oi an ending. In such cases, the 0 beiorer
(aiter c, 0, 0) and the t beiore stand ss coalesce, except in com-
pounds oi ire, with the preceding vowel. Except in the case oi
verbs with monosyllahic stems, Terence probably used the iull
iorms only at the end of averse.

14. nouos: the nom. and acc. sing. oi the ad decl. ended, in the
earliest times, in ·os and -ona These endings became -00 and -cm
about the middle oi the third century nc, except in words in which
they were preceded by 0 (either vowel or consonantal). In such
words, the old endings ·os and -010 remained in common use till

aiter the Augustan period (ci. Quintil. 1, 7, 26). 11 some cases,
when the -00 01 -010 was preceded by 00, these endings were
changed to -00 and -010, and the 00 was avoided by changing 00 to
0, ap. ecce occurs ior 00000.

prologum: one might expect 0οὄ- to correspond with πρόλογος.
The long 0 is probably due to association with the Latin 0160 ct.

mortno (προπίνω).
