In the text editions of antiquity, letters were added to the
superscriptione ol different soenes to indicate the manner in
which they were to be rendered, and these marks are still dis·
tinguishable in some oi the manuscripts of Plautus. These
show that the last two kinds of soenes, (2) and (3) above, as
they were both accompanied by music, were marked with the
lettera, ic. canticum, song3 the first kind (l), with the letters
DV, ic. divertium, spoken dialogue. In the editions of Terence,
aa may be seen irom Donatus, soenes oi a purely lyric character
were marked M.M.C. (perhaps an abbreviation for modi mutati
cantici); those merely recited with musical accompaniment,
simply C. (though this rests upon the opinion of Ritschl, Do·
natus giving us no iniormation on this point); those consisting
ot ordinary dialogue, DV.²

It was customary to have music also before the beginning
of the play (before the prologue) and between the acts. The·
music for the plays oi Plautus and Terence seems to have been
composed entirely by slaves, -that for all the plays of Terence
by Flaccus, the slaveoi Claudius. The music was given by a
single flute-player (tibicen), probably by the composer himself,
witha double flute‚ or, perhaps we might say, clarinet, as the
instrument bore a greater resemblance to it than to our flute.
It was played by blowing into both tubes at the same time.
From the didascalice we learn of iour different kinds oi these

governing the change of verse in these parts have not yet been discov-
ered. K. Meissner‚ in Fleckeisen’s ‹Jahrbiicher (1884), attempts to
show that they are divided into strophas. See also Schlee, de vers. in
cent. Ter. cons. (Berlin, 1879).
