vowel or beiore t, this practice continued to be general even in
classical times. The same was true, lor a long time, oi final a

be disregarded before consonante in the arsis (even oi the last
foot), or in the unaccented syllable oi a resolved thesis, ep.

velue oi only two meroe (instead ol three, as one might expect),
ay. Phorm. 307 and 681. This has commonly been explained
as dne to a shortening of the first syllable, semp& but Skutsch
(Forsoh. zur Lat. Grammatik u. Metrih) makes it seem plausi-
ble that the pronunciation oi these words in such ceses was
, rather semp, und, lad.

3. Influence of verse-Accent and word-Accent

The most important and far-reaching peculiarity oi prosody
to be noted in the dramatic poets is the frequent shorten-
lng ol e long syllable when itis immediately preceded by
a short syllable and immediately preceded, or followed,
by the verse-ictus. The influence ol this “iambic law” (so
called because it concerns the combination υ ...) may, then,
change

(l) v-L to uuL, e-y. Phorm. 113 datm δέ tolalm se‘5

(a) m to c o e, cameratae cenata- φατε aa ιδ’-
quitur to cdnld'qudr qula lte
ldqaituU

(3) (1- to <tv ‚ ey. Phorm3 209 quid hle conterimus to
quld lle conterimus ,·

It is important to note, however, that in such cases the long
syllable may be shortened only when the short syllable im-
mediately preceding begins a word. The shortening‚ further·
more, seems to take place only in the following cases:

ol the final syllable. Compare the shortening ol the originally long
final syllable ln milri, rats, sibi, tti, uti, nisi, quasi, eye, modaetc.
