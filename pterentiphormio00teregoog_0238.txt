volumes are prepared hy special editors, who aim to revise thoi*
text careiully and to edit it in the most seriiceable manner.

Where there are German editions oi unusual merit, representing
years oi special study under the most favorable circumstances,
these are used, with the consent oi the foreign editor, as a basis

text-books of the highest excellence in a comparatively short period

The editions are oi two kinds, couiorming to the different
methods oi studying Latin in oui· beet institutione. Some contain
in the introductione and commentary such a caetui aud minute
treatment oi the author‘s life, langiisge, and style as to efford the

Latin literature. Others aim merely to meist the student to a good
reading knowledge oi the author, end have only the text and briei
explanatory notes at the bottom oi each page. The latter are
particularly acceptable ior sight reading, and ior rapid reading

Plautus and Terence oareiully‚ with special reference to the pecu·
liarities oi style, language, metros, the methods of presenting a
play, aud the like, these editions will be admirably nitted ior the
