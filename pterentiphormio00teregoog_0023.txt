about 190 s.c.² At an early age, he came to Rome as a slave
01 the senator Terentius Lucanus, though how this fact should
be explained is a disputed question. He can hardly have been
taken captive in war, 00 he was born after the end 01 the Second
Punic War and died before the beginning oi the next war with
Carthage. Possibly he was carried off by enemies 01 his native
city, in early youth, and later brought to Rome. Be this as it
may, his master, struck by the talant and the prepossessing ap
pearance oi the boy, not only caused him to be carefully edu-
cated, but also gave him his ireedom. The associatione 10

² The date generally given is 185 s.c., in accordance with Suetonius
in his 0110 Terenti, p. 32 (ed. Ritschl in Reifferscheid, Suet. p. 26 11. and
481 ff. = Opusc. 111, 10411). But Η. Sauppe (Nachr. d. Gdtt. Ges. 1810,
p. 111 ff.) bas made this seem very improbable. Τ110 year 01 Terence’s
birth, like that 01 many other famous men 01 antiquity‚ was not definitely
known even to the scholare 01 ancient Rome. In attempting to estab-
lish the date they acted on the supposition that Terence was 01 1110001110
ageas Ρ. Scipio Africanus the younger. But we know that Terence
brought out his first piace, the Andria, as early as 168 11.0., in view 01
which iact we are, Sauppe thinks, forced to conclude that he must have
been several years older than Scipio. Otherwise the Andria must have
been produced when the author was only ninetoen years 01 aga, and such
a productiori would have required several years 01 careiul preparation.
But it bears every evidence 01 being the work 01 mature years. To be
sure, Terence does not deuy the taunt 01 his opponent (Heaut. Prol. vs.
