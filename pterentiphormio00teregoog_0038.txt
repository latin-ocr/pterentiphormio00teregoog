bet, which letter served also in the text to designate that
character. For the division into soenes, two principles seem to
have been followed in our manuscripts. According to one of
these, a new scene is formed by the exit or the entrance of a
single actor, this being the principle followed, for the most
part, in the Bembinus.¹ Exceptions to this rule are formed by
cases in which a person leaves the stage only for a moment
rof. Phorm. 446), or in which the persons who remain behind
have little to say, and that of no importance, until the entrance
of another actor, or other actore, and the opening of a new
scene (ay. Phorm. 219, 778, 816). According to the other prin-
ciple, anew scene is indicated only where the change of actore
introduces an importantium in the plot. The manuscripts
which follow this principle accordingly indicate no new scene
at Phorm. 7 95, 884. Tm first of these two principles is followed
in the present edition.

’ The Matres of Terence.

The matres found in Terence are, with rare exceptions, either
iambic or trochaic. A peculiarity of an iambic or a trochaic
verse is that it is, at least in Greek poetry, measured b'y dipo· >
dies, ae. pairs of feet, instead of by single feet, each dipody
having one main and one subordinate ictus. Accordingly, a
verse of four feet is called a dimeter (instead of a tetrameter),
one of aix feet a trimeter (instead of a hexameter), etc. Fre·
quently, however, and especially with reference to early Latin
poetry, these verses are called quormcrii, senarii, etc, names
given them solely with reference to the number of feet con-
tained in each, the distinctions between the odd and the even
feet having been, for the most part, lost sight oi by early Latin
poete. We may divide the verses of Terence into the follow·
ing varieties:

1An exception is found, for example, ln Phorm. 441, where lt indi-
catesnonew scene. ·
