THE PHORMIO.

The Phemio was first presented on the stage at the lodi
Romani, in 161 rac. It was modeled after the Epidicazomenon
oi Apollodorus, a play which took its name from the technioal
term ἔπιδικάζειν, “to adjudge (to some one) property under liti-

referred to, he declares in court that Antipho and his father

deny it, he secures a decision of the court, directing that Antipho
