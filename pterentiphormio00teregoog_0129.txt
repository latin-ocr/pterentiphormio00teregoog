DRAMATIS Pnnsounn.

No list oi dramatis personae is iound in the Mes. oi any play
oi Terence. In some oi the Mes. (CFP), however, there is prefixed
ιο each play a picture oi maske representing the characters taking
part ln that particular play. At the beginning oi each scene in
the same Mes. are pictures oi the actore themselves, as they are
supposed to appear at some critical moment in mescone. These
⁴ picturas must be regarded as representing post-Terentian presen-
tations oi the plays, as actore on the Roman stage did not wear
maske in the time oi Terence.

PROLOGUS.

The prologus seems from Heant Prol. 1-s and Hoc. Prol. 11, 1
to have been usually given ιο one oi the younger actore, who was
attired ior the occasion in a particular costuma. Into his mouth
the poet put what he himseli wished ιο say to the audience.

1. pocta uatus refers to Luscius Lanuvinus known chiefly
from the allusione to him in the prologues oi Terence and in the
commentary oi Donatus. Volcacius Sedigitas (see Introd, p. xxvi)
