Asa poet Terence is especially noted for the artistic finish
and refinement oi his productione· The plots of his plays are
careiully thought out and cleverly managed, the poet at times
departing from his Greek original, where he can by so doing
better serve his artistic purpose. No less carefully studied is
his portrayal of character and oi the motives which prompt to
action the persons with whom he is dealing. To be sure, for
all that isessential and best he was indebted to his Greek
originale, but he deserves homage ior having successiully re·
produced these merits in his own plays. Indeed, in some oi the
details, he has even ventured to make improvements upon his
originals.¹ As tc the language of Terence, it is at all times ee-
lect and pure and may pass as the best example we have oi the
colloquial language ae used by the more refined circles oi Ro-
man society. Cicero and Caesar, who must surely be looked
upon ae competent judges, accord him in this respect the highest
praise. But the excellences above mentioned are such as de-
pend chiefly upon thought and study and painstaking. On the
other hand one cannot iail to notice in Terence, as compared
with Plautus, acertain lack of vigor, of sparkling, spontaneous
wit, oi liveliness, of variety in his characters, and oi power in
depicting passion.. Upon the absence oi these characteristica,
the enemies oi Terence based their accusation that his plays
were “tenui oratione el scriptura lcui'’ (Phorm. Prol. 5); and even
Caesar complains that the “ lenia scripta” oi Terence lack “ ert
comicc.’' It was probably ior this reason, too, that Volcacius
Sedigitas (about the end oi the second century n.c., author oi
atreatise de poetis), in naming the ten most noted writers oi
fabulae palliatae in the order oi their merit, assigned Terence to
the sixth place.

It is further to be noticed, that no development in the genius
oi the poet can be discovered in the course oi his productioris.
This ie, without doubt, due ior the most part to the repression
