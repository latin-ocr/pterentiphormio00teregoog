XXX INTRODUCTION.

ageres the troupe was a freedman who also toolr part in the
acting and was sometimes called the actor (ie. par excellence).
At first, pects were wont to bring out their plays themselves,
hiring slaves and freedmen for the purpose, but this practice
ceased at an early date, and, as early as Plautus, the poet him·
seli was no longer actor also, The Stichus oi Plautus, ior in-
stance, according to the didascalia, was brought out by T.
Publilius Pellio,1 who is severely criticised by the poet himself
(Bacch. 214 i.) lor the manner in which he put the Epidicus
on the stage.

Το these theatrical managers application was made by those
who wished to give dramatic entert tainments. The poets thad
business relat' trous, ior the most part, only wrt 'th the actores, who
bought, or rejected, their plays, and these actores accordingly
were very influential in determining the fate and encouraging
the development of poetic talent. Iu exceptione] cases, how·
ever, the givers of the gemes, as they were men oi experience
in such matters and naturally felt great interest in the success
of the periormances, had a voice in the selection of the plays to
be presented. All fiuaucial risk attending the presentatiou of a
play had to be borne by the theatrical manager‘ (the dominus).
As it was ol great importance to the givers oi the gemes, that
the people should be pleased with the amusements provided ior
them at such great expense, arewsrd was offered to the dominas,
varying in amount according to the success of the play given by
Ιιίιιι.2 This of course was calculated to secure the choice of the
best possible play and to assure its presentation in the best pos-
sible manner. 'l‘he dominus on his part was accustomed, alter
a successful performance, to reward the¹ deserviug actore ol his

company witha banquet. cf. Plaut. cist, end; Rud. 1418 ff.

1'‘doilieassertion ol Mommsen, Elim. (lesch 1..⁸p 889, that the poets
received their reward only when the play did not prove a iailure, has
not been substantiated.
