mission to use, in any way that might suit my purpose,
the very valuable material collected in his own edition
of the Phormio, representing as it does a thorough study
of all the literature upon Terence and allied subjecte
that had appeared up to 1884. Much‚ however, has been
done in this field during the last ten years, and the

· results of such labors have, so far as seemed desirable,

been incorporated in the present volume. Ι have
thought it worth while tc append below a classified
bibliography of the literature especially concerned with
Terence that has appeared since the completion of
Dziatzho's edition.

I feel myself under lastiug obligations to Professor E.

M. Pease, Editor-in-chief of the series to which this book
Ἴ belongs, to Professor O. E. Bennett of Cornell University‚
aud to Professor H. N. Fowler of the western Reserve
*University for the searching criticism to which they
have subjected all parts of the book. I am further
indebted to Professor Pease for his hindness in placing
at my service his collation of the Codex Parisinus.
