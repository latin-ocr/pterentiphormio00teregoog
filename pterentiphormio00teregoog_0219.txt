speaker. There seems to be no inherent reason why the infinitivo
should not be so usedbut as a matter of fact it dces not οοοιιι,
ιο far as I can find, anywhere in Latin, with the possible exception
„ of lece erembolem aeaire‚inPhor1n.339. Even there, the speaker
seems to be almost depreeating the hard lot of a ree. In Tac. Dial.
6, 16, eolre populum is better taken with qaod gaudium. See
Bennett’s note οιι this latter passage.

896. This verse is found in the Mssafter 9053 but itis clear
that it properly comes before Phormio joins in the conversation.

992. I have retained the reading of A. Dziatzko, following
O. F. W. Mliller, reiecta this reading because it requires the short-
ening of the second e in cerebbme‘ai, which, it is claimed, cannot
be allowed for Terence. Accordingly, eerebcmiat' is changed to
aa rebemt'ae' ; and as this alteration makes the ae aon id jecorem
of the next verse unintelligible, these latter words are changed ιο
me aaa id secere, against the uniform reading of the Mes. There
are seven instances in Terence of the shortening of the second
syllable oi a polysyllahic word when that syllable' rs‘ ‘long by
positionp' and the retus falls on the thrrd ιιόιιιριᾱιι, inHeaut 71,
And 944 960, Hec. 6933 ιιοιιῖιιιᾶιιο, in Hec. 8485 seaeotetem, in
Phorm. 434· ,ιηᾰοῖοινᾶιιιι inEun. 22 It seems easier ιο suppose
thata vowel‘ ‘long by nature'’ was occasionally shortened, under
similar circumstances, than to do away with all exceptione tc the
rule by making arbitrary changes in the Mes. Cf. Plaut. Men. 31,
Syraciisas ; also Amph 930 pdffwttiem (according to some editors).

913. cem aeae: Dziatako, in his last edition, following BODP,
reads ιιιιιιο uiduam. 1 have followed A. The word uiduam, in
the inferior Mes, looks like a gloss upon eom acac.

949. scatentia: this is the reading of all the Mas, but it has
been arbitrarily changed by Fleckeisen, whom Daiatzko follows, to
inconstantia. Ι see no serious difficulty in sententia, which is
used in the sense of doctrice, determination, and which, when
modified by puerili, becomes nearly synonymous with inconstan-
tic. For scatentia in the sense oi determination, purpose, seeAuct
ad Her. 3, 24, 4ι); Cic. Off. 3, 33, 116.
