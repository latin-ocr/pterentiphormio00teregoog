of respectior the product of another's genius is noteworthy
as showing that a play, oi which a translation, or an adapta·
tion, had been made by a Latin poet, was thenceiorth looked
upon as his own property. Terence as a rule respected this
principle. In several cases, where his enemies accuse him oi
theft (furseus), he proves his production to be entirely “ new ”
(oi. Ad. Prol. 6-14), or excuses himself on the plea of ignorance
of any previous use oi it. But it may be doubted, from his
words iu Eun. Prol. 27 (Si id est peccatam, etc.) and 35 ff,
whether he loolred upon the use oi a Greek drama, or apart
oi oue, by several Latin poets, as a very serious offense. η

All six plays oi Terence met with great applause from the
public, though the Hecyra was not received with lavor until
the third attempt to present it. The greater attraction, formed
by other amusemeuts at the time oi the first and second
attempta to present this piece, made it impossible to act any
oi it the first time, and only one act oi it at the second attempt
(cf. Phor. Prol. 31 n.; Hec. Prol. Laud IL). The Eunuchus,
on the other hand, met with such success that its productior]
was repeated (probably on the same day), and the poet received
thereior the unusually large sum oi eight thousand sesterces
(about three hundred and thirty dollars).

After the third production oi the Hecyra, in 160 ac, Terence
left Rome ior Graece, probably to acquire a more intimate
knowledge oi the life and customs of the people of that coun-
try. In the following year, 159 nc, the poet died, while on
the point oi returning to Rome with translations which he had
recently made oi other ,comedies Hc methis death either by
shipwreolr off the island of Leucas, or else, aiter losing his bag·
gage and his manuscripts by such a mishap, died at Stymphalus
in Arcadia. He left a daughter, who was afterward married to
a Roman knight. His property attha time of his death probably
consisted oi twenty acres oi land, though another account rep
resents him as having been reduced to absolute poverty.

Regarding the personal appearance ol Terence, Suetonius

says: Fuisse dictur raediocri statura, gracili corpore, colore fusco.
