uses cet-1 quoius, quoi, quom, quor, etc. (= calos, cul, eta).
The forms pratus and prata (when used as substantives), per·

· haps also proditer (Eun. 51), still retain their initial p.

Assimilation of consonante does not, as a rule, appear in
the written form. This is particularly the case with ia, except,
apparently, in the very common words imperium, imperare,1 im·
patrare. Ad is assimilated only before ce, cl (accedere, accidere,
but 01100000νεῖ), pe (appellere, but adportare, adprobare, etc.) and
a· (attinere, attiapere). On the whole, the process of assimilation
seems to have gone further in the more common words than in
those less frequently used. B in ab and ob before s and thas
very commonly in the Mss. become p.

The Mss. show great wavering between d and t at the end of
certain pronouns and partiales (ap. id, it, illud, illut, aliud, aliut,
apud, apat), but this variation in spelling was, without doubt,
common among the ancients themselves. in this edition the
usual orthography has been followed, except where the Mss. are
decisivo for another. See note on vs. 159.

(4) Dative (and perhaps the genitive) occasionally in e, in
words of the fifth declension.

(5) Genitive occasionally in -1 in those pronouns and adjec-

tives which regularly have ius in that case, ep. culli consili
(And. 608).
