tained also the lost play, as three leaves ol this Ms. still bear
witness.

‘We hear oi a certain M. Plautius, belonging to about the
same period, who was also a writer of comedim, but we know
nothing very definite about him. The similarity between his
name and that of Plautus may easily have brought it about
that his plays were ascribed to the better known poet. ¹

Q. Ennius is chiefly notedfor his epic poem called Annales-
in which he relatae, in eighteen books, the entire history of Romo
from the earliest times down to his own-for his saturae, and
his tragedias. But he also attempted comedy, and so deserves

mention here. He was born at Rudiae in Calabria in 239

nc. He was brought to Rome from Sardinia in 204 by the -

quaestor M. Porcius Cato, and herc he seems to have lived
in moderate circumstances as teachcr oi Greek and as stage
poet. In 184 rac. he received the right of Roman citizenship
which he lived to enjoy ior fifteen years. None oi his come·

dies have come down to us—not even in fragments oi any

importanoe.

The next poet worthy of mention in this connection is
Statius Caecllius, who enJ‘oyed an enviable reputation among
the ancients as awriter oi palliatae, and who was an important
forerunner oi Terence. An Insubrian by birth, he came to Rome
about 194 rac, probably as a captive taken in war. Later, how·
ever, he was given his ireedom. His first attempt at comedy
failed and was not even heard to the end by the impatient
audience3 but he toiled on till he won literary iame and a
name among comio poets second only, as yet, to that oi Plautus.
He died soon after Ennius, with whom in lile he had beenon
the most intimate terme.

We now come to a poet who calls for a more extended notice,
one whose name is always coupled with that of Plautus as one
01 the two greatest names in Roman comedy-Publius ‘l'eren-
tius Afer. He was a native of Carthago. His surname‚ Afer,
however, makes it probable that he was not oi Phoenician

blood, but that his parents belonged to one oi the African
