never recovered irem the spell that was thus east about them.
Instead ei attempting to create aliterature oi their own along
independcnt lines, they now devoted themselves chiefly to copy·
ing the masterpieces of Greeee. The first truite oi this new
influenee were seen in mere translations and adaptatione from
the Greek. The comedies that were thus translated, or adapted
are called schalae palliatae, from the Greek eloah (palliam)
worn by the aetors, to distinguish them from the fabulae togatae
in which Roman manners were represented. The first writer
to be mentioned in this connection is Livius Andronicus,
who was born at Tarentum about 284 rae. After the capture

oi his native city in 272 rac, he became the slave ei Μ. Livius
Salinator, who, charmed by the talenta of the young man, soon
afterwards gave him his treedom. In 240 Livius was engaged
to produce, as one oi the attractione of the ludi Romani, two
Latin plays, a tragedy and a comedy, adapted from Greek origi·
nals. Such dramatic entertainments had ior a long time been
regularly given in the original Greek in the towns ol southern

Italy and so were more or less familiar to the Romans. These
periormanees found such favor at Rome that irem this time on
they became a regular part oi the gamos. Livius Andronicus
must then be looked upon as having introduced a new era for
the Roman people. In Livy the historian (7, 2), the existence
oi a connected plot and the systematic arrangement oi the con·
tents are designated as the features that distinguished the new
drama irem the old setara. It was further distinguished by
the employment of Greek matres and by differenees in the
form oi representation. Only a iew fragments of the plays of
Livius have come down to us. We know, however, that hc was
held in so great esteem at Rome that, in honor ef him, the tem·
ple ot Minerva cn the Aventino was appropriated to the use oi
scribae et terriones, who organized themselves into a sort oi poets'

Another writer, likewise active in beth tragedy and eomedy‚
was 011. Naevius, a native oi Campania, born about 265 rac.
Bein g a Latin by deseent, he took part in the First Punic war.
