of the individuality of writers of palliatae in general, and espe-
cially at the time of Terence, but it is due in part also to tho
shortness ol the period through which his entire literary
activity lasted. At any rate, it isquite impossible for us to
designate any ono oi his six plays as the immature work of his
youth.

History ol the Text.

After the death of Terence, the writing of fabulae palliatae
almost ceased.² In the absence oi new productions, the custom
now began of presenting again upon the stage the plays of
former poete. It was but natural that many changes should
be made in these old plays to make them better suited to the
altered conditione under which they were to be reproduced,
though Terence has suffered but little in this respect as com·

the end ot the first century nn.) translated Greek comedies, but these
productioris were intended only for reading,

² Tmre can be no doubt that the camedies ol Plautus are preserved
to us in the form which they received to fit them tor reproduction long
after the time ol Plautus. With Terence the case is different. The
iact that the prologues to his plays, though appropriate only lor the
particular occasion lor which they were written, have come down to
us mahanged, is a clear procl that, at the time when the comedies ot
