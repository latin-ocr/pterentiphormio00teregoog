3. Iembic septenarius (Tetrameter catalectio), called
septenarius because only seven feet are complete, though it really
contains seven and a half 1001. The caesurais (o) usually 01100
the fourth 1001, which then presente the same peculiarities 01
treatment as in the octonarius under similar conditions; (b)
sometimes after the arsis 01 the fifth foot.

4. Iambic Quaternarlus (Dimeter Acatalectic), rare in
Terence, occurring only three times in the Phormio (000163,
183, 196). This verse is usually employed as 0 clausula (see p.
xxxvi) in connection with octonarii and septenarii. Here the ,
proceleusmatic is not found in Terence.

’10000010 :

Any one of the substitutas allowed in iambio verses for the
pure iambus nray, except as indicated below, also stand here 100
the pure trochce, L υ, the metrical secent being, however, in
all cases, upon the first syllable of the 1001. The proceleus
matio is found in Plautus, though notin Terence, as a substi-

tute 100 0 trochee.

1. Trochaic Octouarius (Tetrameter 1100010100τὶ0).-
This verse is used only in lyric parts 01 the plays, in connec-
tion with other verses, to form special rhythmis systems. In
Terence trocheis octonarii are always followed by troclaic sep-
1000011.

The caesurais (α) usually after the fourth 1001, from which
1001 the dactyl is then excluded3 (i) sometimes in the fourth
or fifth foot. In this verse a tribrach, a spondae, or 00 ana·
paest is allowed eren in the eighth foot.
¹ 2. Trocheic septenarius (Tetrameter Catalectio), called
septenarius because only seven feet are complete, though it
really contains seven and a half 1001. This verse in Terence
is, in point 01 frequency, next to the iambic senarias. The
caesura may be (0) 01100 the fourth trechas, in place 01 which
adactyl is not then admissible, 00 (b) after the fifth arsis, gen-
erally with a minor caesura after the fourth thesis or the third
arsis. In this verse, as in iambic verse, 00 anapaest is not used
