888. dudum: viz. in 665.

840. ostium concrepuit: the doors of Greek houses often
opened outward. They were frequently (regularly, in the case of
families who could not afford to keep an ostiariae to tend the door)
kept bolted on the inside (of. Heaut. 275 fi.; Ad. 634). The expres·
sion ostium concrepuit seems to refer to tho noiso attendant upon
drawing the holt and starting tho door, all of which would indicate
that some one was about to come out. It is commonly explained,
chiefly on the authority of Plutarch (Poplic. 20), as referring to a
knock by which a person about 6ο come out is supposed to have
warned passere-by against the danger of being hit by the door.
But such extreme precaution would in any case seem absurd and
nnnecessary, especially so when we know that other noises accom-
panied the opening of a locked door, in ancient, as well as in
modern, times. Another serious obiection is the fact that concre-
pare refers to a rattling, creaking, or grating sound, not at all
to anything like a knock, which is indicated by pulsare, pultare,
pellere-words never used of persons about to come ont of a
house. Plutaroh's remarks are professedly based upon expressions
of this sort found in the comio poets, and are probably due to a
misunderstanding.

The tense of concrepuit is to be explained as referring to the
instant before, just as we upon hearing a knook may say, “some
one knocked,’' as well as “some one is knocking.”
