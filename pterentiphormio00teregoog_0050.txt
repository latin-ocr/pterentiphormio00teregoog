(6) The common use of the particle -ce in the genitive singu· ·
lar, and in the genitive, dative, accusative, and ablative plural
of the pronoun tic, ey. trice, tusce. Terence commonly uses
these forms with ce only before vowels and t.

Hisce is used in Eun. 269 as the masculine, and toee regularly
as the feminine, form of the nominative plural

(7) Ipsus sometimes for ipse, ey. Phorm. 178.

4. Peculiarltlee of coniugation.

chiefly, as deponent; ey. luctare, altercare, conflictare (= con·
tend with).

(2) The frequent use of -itom, -ito for decom, -iam in the
singulm of the imperfect and future of verbs of the fourth con·
jugation. Aio is the only verb in Terence which shows the
shorter form also in the plural, eq. And. 534, Phorm. 572.

(3) Syncopated forms (socelled 1) in the second person singu·
lor indicative, and more rarely in the infinitivo of the perfect,
when ror c precedes the -isri or -isse, ey. seneli for sensisti, dicti
for diruti, iocre for iussisse, produxe for produxisse.

(4) The regular (probably invariable) use of -re instead of
·n's in the second person singular passive of the tenses formed
from the infinitive stem.

(5) The ending -ier, as well as «ἱ, in the present passive
infinitive but only at the end of averse, or a half-verse (before
the caesura) which closes with an iambus. See p. xxxix,
note 2.

(6) The use of siem, etc, for sim, etc, but only at the end of
a verse, or a half-verse (before the caesura). See p. xxxix,
note 2.

¹Some scholare, eg. Brugmenn, followed by Stolz (Lateinlsche For·
menlehre, ad od.. ξ 112), rejecting the theory rhet these forms are the
result of syncopation, regard them as reminiscenoes of an old form.
See, however, Lindsay, Latin Language‚ p. 464.
