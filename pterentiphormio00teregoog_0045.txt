1, vowels.

The final syllables of words in archaia Latin present a long
iist of vowels long by nature, which were afterward shortened
This was especially the ease in Ennius and Plautus. From Ter·
ence may be cited stetit (Phorm. 9), ouyedt (Ad. 25).

2. consonante.

In the earliest Latin, no such thing was known as the donbling
of consonante in writing. The distinctness with which certam
syllables were pronounced was constantly varying. Ennius
was the first to introduce the doubling of consonante in writ·
ing1 and thus to put an end to the wavering and uncertainty

of the prosody in such cases, though the mles he established
did not, nor could it be expected that they would, come at once
into general favor. Terenceis already under the influence of
Ennius in this respect, bnt the former habits sometimes assert
themselves even in him, e. 9. tlte, base, tecum quim, tmmo, etc.
It will further be noticed that, in early Latin, the addition
of l, or r, to a mute does not ordinarily make along syllable,
ey. pdlrem. In the pronunciation of everyday lise, there
wasa tendency (clearly shown in the inscriptions) to slur over ·
certain consonants, especially when these were at the end oi
a word. The same tendency is seen in early poetry, certain
final consonants being sometimes disregarded to suit the re·
quirements of prosody. In the case of m before a following

ponnds; the present passive infinitiva in -ler; the long quantity of the
first syllable in fieri, fierem, etc.; dissyllabic ailath short vowels in
cases like emerunt (Eun. 20); the lorms duint, perductam neglect ol
syncope in the declension ol denter and siniam the lorms succ,
coeperet (Ad. 397), aeduos (Phorm. 993), cttt‘yaa (And. 789), mauolt
(Hoc. 540), conplures (Phorm. 611).

1 Hianad occurs in an inscription ot 211 rac. (c,1,L. 1, 5³0), bnt this
is in mere imitation ol the Greek Ἐννα. Sea Lindsay, Latin Language
(1894), p. 8.
