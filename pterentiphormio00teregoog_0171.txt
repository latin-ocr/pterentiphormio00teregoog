508. heia, ne . . . sies: this ne clause must be regarded as
dependent, corastinum, leat, eto. With very rare exceptione (and
these are easily aooounted for), prohibitione only oi the mildest sort
are expressed by ue with the present subiunctive. It this were a
prohibition, we should expect ue . . . fueris. Β. 276; G. 272, 2, R.

pamm ε adverbs are not infrequently thus used with substantives
which characterize, te. whioh are in effect adjectival. Gi. Plaut.
Mil. 11, tom bellatorem ; Pers. 683, aot leno.

510. ain: what! asoiten.

mutet: break.

513. dum . . . adiero: while . . ,Ι om pettinp.

514. ne oppertus ales: the peri„ instead of the pres. subj. or
the imperat, betrays the emotion oi the speaker. As regards tha
relative vigor oi the two tenses, the differente between themis
similar to that between “be gone l ’¹ and “go i ” See notes on 501
and 516.

516. idem: in English one would say too; a common use oi
idem where an additional statement is emphatieally made regard-
ing the same person.

tueris: ior erto. titt, suero, eto. sorsum, ero, eto, in oompound
tenses are especially common in early Latin in deponent verbe.

conduplicauerlt: a future peri. is oiten used in Latin as a vig-
orous means oi emphasizing the promptness and certainty oi a
future aot. It will be so prompt and certain that it is indicated
by a tense that lays stress upon its actual aoeomplishment. Cf.
“ Utter one 'word‚ and you ore o deod mou,” “Have douo with

such talk l (ii you do not, you’ll repent it),” expressions prompted
by a similar feeling. This use oi the int. perf. must be careiully
distinguished irom the true fut. perf„ on the one hand, and the
simple fut, on the other. See notes 501 and 514.

518. horuncr for the gender‚ see A. d G. 187 b; B. 235; G. 286,
1, and 290; H. 439.

519. neque ego neque tu: probably without any definite verb
understood. The laok oi a verb would be supplied by an impatient
gesture. Dziatzko understands potero patr· ; but the idea called ior
seems to be, neither you aar I need hother about thot-thot’s bia

orta business.
