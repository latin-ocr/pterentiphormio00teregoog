The unfortunate result of the Peloponnesian War, which
broke the fresh, seliconscious vigor oi Athens, forms a turning·
point in the history oi Attic comedy. With sager participation
of the people in public astaus, died out also their interest iu
them3 other and narrower interests—above ull, material inter·
ests began to engross their attention. They had been wont to
spare neither pains nor expense in organizing, equipping and
