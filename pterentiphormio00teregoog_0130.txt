exists3 οοιιᾳοοο, ιο what has long since passed away. In 14,
Terence cells himself nouos. Lanuvinus did all in his power ιο
injure Terence and prevent the successful production oi his plays.
The decided success oi the Eunuchus, which had been brought out
shortly before this and to which verses 3 ff. allude, shows how
ineffectual these attempts were.

Notics the ulliteration in the first verse. Alliteration seems to
be much more common in the early period oi a literature than
during the period oi its maturity. It is iar more frequent in
Plautus than in Terence (though very common in the latter’s pro-
logues), and in classice] times is comparatively rare. The same
istrue oi Anglo-Saxon, es compared with later English literature.

2. mandere: for tradere. See App.

4. antehac: ulways dissyllabis in Terence.

5. ondens: portrcpcl of character,· scriptino: style. Notice
the obruemur, one of the most common means oi producing ern·
phasis in Letin ; ci. 13 i., 20, etc.

7. ceruam lugere ε inthe sense oi ceruam sapientem. The per·
ticipial construction with verbs oi perception is comparatively rare

ln early Latin. In classical times, such verbs take either (1) the ini.
vitu subject ecc, a construction which calls into prominence the

performance oi the act; or (2) a participle agreeing with en obiect,
ln which case special attentionis called to the object itseli, while
engaged in performing the act. With verbs like uidere these two
constructione express practically the same thing. Ii one sees that
a person is running, he sees the person running, and vice versa.
With such a verb as audire, however, the usege is more strict,
since one may hear that a person is singIng (ep. in a neighboring
town) without actually hearing that person.

These verses refer to something objectionable in the writings oi
Luscius. Scenes oi this sort would be more suitable ior tregedy,
and are avoided by Terence, oi whom Euanthius (sth cent. i.n.),
ln his prefate to the plays, says: (Terentiae) temperavit wectum,
ae ia tragoediam transiliret.

9. quom: always thus spelled till citer Plautus and Terence.
(ilcero probably wrote cum, but quum did not come into use till
several centuries later.

stetit: ior theiong final syllable, see Introd, p. xl. Quone,
