exposing the secretos Phaedria. The play might well hare
corne to a rapid close after vs. 947, when all the complicatione
had come to a happy termination. Still, it is quite in harmony
with the bold, determined character of Phormio, that he im·
proves the opportunity ior the spirited scene which follows3
and again the demands os justice, as it were, required that
Chremes should be made to pay the penalty oi his faithlessness
aad ill-becoming conduct For Phaedria there was the prospect
oi winning his mother as an ally in his loveaffair, and for
Phemio that of becoming a permanent guest in the house oi
Chremes (ci. vs. 1050 n). Whatever may he said regarding
this addition from an artistic point oi view, it may at any rate
be said that the play is thereby enriehed by a very effective
scene.

The Phormio, in addition tc the excellences which mark the
manner in which the plot is carried out and its portrayal of
character, is distinguished also forits spirited and smoothly
flowing language. It met with a decided success at its first
presentation. The rdle of Phormio was, according to Donatus
(Phorm. Π. 2, l), taken bythe theatrical director, Ambivius, him·
self, to the entire satisfaction of the poet It is probable from
vs. 378 that Phormio is to be thought oi as a young man.

The production of the Phormio was probably repeated at the
Indi Megalenses in 141 rec. under the directiones L. Atilius
Praenestinus. N otices to that effect are found in the didascalia
oi the play. In antiquity it was without doubt one oi the best
known comedies extant, being a favorite both on the stage and
for private reading. Itis owing to this fact that Phormio
became in antiquity the universal type of a bold and insolent
man.¹ A drama (mime‘i) of the same name was written by
