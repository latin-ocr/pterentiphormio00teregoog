attacks upon individuale have ceesed3 only typical characters,
such as‘bragging soldiers, sponging parasitos, end insolent syco
phants, are held up to ridicule. As compensation ior this nar-
rower range oi subjecte, appears invention oi new situations
and oi amusing complicatione out oi which the seme ever-re-
curring characters have to extricato themselves. in this respect
the iruitiul, untiring genius oi the poets oi the new comedy
challenges our admiration, though our estimete oi them isbased
upon mere fragments irom their plays end upon Latin pleys that
are modeled efter them.

With reference to drumutic arrangement and technique, the
new comedy as well as the old is modeled after tragedy, and
especially aiter the tragedy oiEuripidee. It is characterized by
the same morelizing tone prevalent in the werke oi thet author.
The numerous maxims, however, which lend this color are, in
the new comedy, brought into the pley only incidentally, while
in the old Attio comedy, with its vigorous essaults upon every·
thing that wes blameworthy, they seemed an orgenic pert oi the
play itseli.

Among the poete oi the new Attic comedy, oi whom there
were more than sixty, the most distinguished in the judgment oi
antiquity was Menander (342-290 no). Next to him, Phile·
mon, Diphilus, Philippidee,1³osidippue, end Apollodorus oi
Carystus, ure to benamed as the iavorite writers of comedy. Oi
the original productione cf these poets only a iew fragments
heve come down to us. We have, however, Latin adaptations
irom some of their plays in the two great comic poete of Rome,
Plautus and Terence.

Oi course the transition irom the old to the new comedy was
agredual one. It extended over a period oi fifty years, irem
the Plutus ot Aristophanes (presented first in 408 end again,
this time in a revised iorm and without chorus and perebasis,
in 388) to about the time oi the Macedonian sovereignty (338).
The best known poeis oi this period are Antiphanes end
Alexis. Whether we should loolr upon this socelled middle
comedy as forming a distinct type by itseli may-be questioned3
