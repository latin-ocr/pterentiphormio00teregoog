for the spectatore, while those in front would not obstruet the
view of those in the rear. On such a slope the people as-
sembled under the open shy. As no seats were provided for
their accommodatiori, they usually sat, or reclined, upon the
ground. The more fastidious sometimes had stools brought
for them from their homes, although this was looked upon
as a mark of effeminacy and was even forbidden. In 179 aa,
a stage of stone was erected near the temple of Apollo, but
this was of small dimensione and was probably intended for
nse only at the ludi Apollinares. Five years later, arrangements
were made, on the part of the state, for the building of a sub
stantial, immorable stage,1butthis, if it was actually built,
seems soon to have disappeared. ln 146 rao, L. Mummius built
acomplete theatra, provided with rows of seats, but this was of
wood, and was torn down after each performance. Finally, in
55 rac, was dedicated the stane theatro of Cn. Pompeius, the
first permanent theatro erected in Rome. It was capable of
‘accommodating forty thousand spectatore.

The dramatic performances usually took place between pran-

part of the day's exemisse, it seems hardly possible that more
than one play could, as a rule, have been presented on any one
day. Later, in Cicero's time, the castam of giving these per·
formances in the early morning was introduced.

When the tadi scaenici were to be given, the fact was an-

there was a titali pronuntiatio, an announcement of the subject
of the play; bnt sometimes the prologue itself conveyed to the
audience their first information regarding the subject of the
play and the name of the poet. The actors were slaves, or, in
later times, freedmen‚ this profession being considered beneath
the dignity of free-born men. The deminuam general man·
