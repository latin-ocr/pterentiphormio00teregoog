montaries became very common early in imperial times, and
these oi course offered a good basis for revisions. Such corn·

mentaries were prepared by Probus (probably Μ. Valerius
Probus, about the middle of the first century nn), Aemilius
Asper, Arruntius celsus (perhaps only to the Phormio),
Helenius Acro, Euanthius, and the soruewhat later Aelius
Donatus (about the middle of the fourth century nna). We
have a commentary, bearing the name oi tho last-mentioned
scholar, to five oi the plays (that to the Heaut. being lost).
This is a confused compilation oi extraots from different
commentaries (at least two), which themselves contained

third century, while some scholars differ from these views so iar that
they assign it to the seventh century. Dziatzlro (commentationes
Wolffliniae, Leip. 1891) and Schlee (Scholia Terentiana, Leip. 1893) rep-
resent the latest views in assigning it to the flith century.
