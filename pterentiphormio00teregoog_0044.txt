tibiae aemonae of which but little is known, though they were
probably oi equal length13 and

duae dextrae tibiae in which the two tubes were oi equal length
and identical in key and note.

Regardin g the lastmentioned tibiae, we are told by Varro that
the right tube was for leading (titia incentiuc), the left lor ac·
eompanying (tibia everentiae). We have no further knowledge
regarding the difference between the various kinds of these
instruments; but we may be certain that the choice oi instru-
ment depended upon the character of the play. In the case of
the Heauton timorumenos, we know from the didascalia that
instrumente were changed in the course of the play itseli. ’

An important difference between the practices of the ancient
and of the modern stage may be inferred from Livy, 7, 2, 8 ff.
It is here recorded that, from the time oi Livius Andronicus
throughout the whole period when Roman comcdy was at ite
height, the lyrical parts were sung by a person especially se-
lected for the purpose and stationed near the fluteplayer, while
the actore meanwhile were wont merely to act silently, in e
manner suitable to the words thus sung.

PROSODY.

The prosody and the langnege of Terence differ iar less from
those of the later, classieal authors, than do those ol Plautus,
though there were only a few years between the two writers.
Peculiarities ol this nature will be pointed out in detail in the
notes. The more important oi these, however, may well finde
plaee in this introduction²
