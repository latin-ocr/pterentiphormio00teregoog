Iambic ε

In all iambic verses, any one of the following feet is allowed
as a substitute for the pure iambus, υ L: (a) anapaest, w L,
(b) spondes, > L3 (c) tribrach‚ υ <103 (d) dactyl, > <a υς
(e) proceleusmatio, w ό υ. It should be noticed, however,
that the last foot of an acatalectic verse is invariably a pure
iambus (with the privilege, of course, of the syllaba anceps), and
that a proceleusmatic is never used by Terence in the fifth ieet-¹

1. Iambic senarius (Trimeter Acatalectic). - This verse,
patterned after the Greek trimeter, constitutos fully half of
each play of Terence.

The caesuras may be classified as follows, in the order of
their frequency: (a) the so-called penthemimeral, after the
arsis oi the third feet, aq. υ.. υ-υ ΙΙ -υ-υ-υ 23
(b) the hepthemimeral, after the arsis of the fourth feet,
e-y. υ-υ-υ-υΙΙ-υ-υκ-κ, in which case there is
often diaeresis after, or a secondary caesura in, the second
feet. Not many verses are without one oi these caesuras.

In connection with this verse, the following peculiarities
call for notice: (1) An anapaest is not allowed immediately
astera dactyl; (2) When a proceleusmatic is used, its ictus·
syllable nearly always begins avvord, and the ictus and word·
accent, with rare exceptione, coincide. The proceleusmaticis
most common at the beginning of a verse.

2. Iambio octonarius (Tetrameter Acatalectic).-The
caesura oi this verse falls into two classes: (o) It may be after
the fifth arsis, ae. υ·-υ-υ..υ-υ ΙΙ-υ-υ-υ-; (b) it
may be at the end of the fourth foot, cy. u-u-v-u μ ll
υ - υ , υ ,,, υ μ, in which case the fourth foot is treated like
the final foot of the verse, le. it must be a pure iambus, hiatus
is sometimes allowed after it (at least in Plautus), and certain
forms, otherwise used in iambic metres only at the end of a
verse (ey. siet, the infinitivo in -ἱεν, eto), are also used here.

1 Dziatzko claims that it is allowed ln the fifth loct3 bnt see Ap-
pendix on vs. 598.
