junctive, but without ut, isused in 1 question lmplylng refusal to
comply, or, in the csse of 1 statement, to believe.

Notice ths indignation implied in this line hythe uss and the
relative position of the pronouns (epo illam 0111 illo), 111
brought in before the ut. See note 011109.

11111 1111111111 11 the perfect tense, but this form in a passive
senso is extremely 1111 11 111 times, and to Plautus and Terence 11
11 entirely unknown. Meritum (sc. 101111) here 11 best taken sub-
stantively 11 in 1051, pol 1111111111 tuom ‚· Heaut. 92, sic meritumst

conmonstrarlsrz 10 be 110111; demonstrasses (301), 10 be
pointed out. For -ier see Introd, p. xlv.

30⁷. nempe: 101 meon: for thc quantity, ses 11111011, p. xli.

308. faxo: parenthetical. This is archaio for secero, -so (sis,
-st't, eto.) being added to the verbstem (sac-so). In the first and
second conjugatione, -sso (esis, -ssit,etc.) is found. These archaic
cndings are found in the 4111 conj. only in ambissit and ambissint.
Cf. the corresponding subjunctive in -11111 (sis, sit). With the
exception of saxo, susim, and ausim, Terence uses these forms
very sparingly, ep. 742, appellaverim And. 760, excessis. See
Introd, p. 111. The tense of saxo here adds to thc notion of
certainty and promptness of accomplishmcnt. Such 1 use of the
fut. perf. is very common in carly Latin. This tense is appropriate
ln such cases, only because the progress of the aot 11 disregarded‚
and the 11111 conceived 01 as already accomplished as soon 11
began. A similar feeling prompte expressions like “I must bc
off,” instead of “I must go.”

399. adduce: in carly Latin, duce, dice, and socc are some·
times found for duo, dio, soc,· in Terence, however, dios does not
occur at all and 111101 11 found only in compouuds. Face 11 con·
iincd to the end of 1 verse.

311. The first duty of 1 Roman, upon returning home, was to
pay his respects to his household gods. Cf. Plaut. Stich. 134.

312. aliquod: commonly written aliquot. See note on 119.

313. adolente see Introd, p. mix, 110112.
