ueras. 147

966-967. hoc iretus . . . quom . . . excessit: quom is here ·
equivalent to an explicetive quod, tlte fuet that, or in thot. This
use was entirely distinet in both origin and development, irem the
temporal or causei quom (cem), and was always used with the
indicative. Itis very common in early Latin and isnotinirequent
even in classioal timec, especially aiter such expressions as gratulor,
gratias oco, etc. The passage eo . . . cum . . . consecutus est in
Cic. de sen. la, 68 has been corrupted by some editors, owing to a
failure to recognize this use. See App.

967. unde = a quo.

969. exre: see note on 449.

istius: dissyllabic.

976. ain tu: merely a formula expressive of indignation, won-
der, or the like. The tu is commonly added only when strongly
marked contrast with others is intended. Here PhormIo has J'ust
addressed Demipho. He now turns ιο Chremes with aad what
do you mecei

lubitum luerit=labitam sit. See note on 616. This subjunc-
tive takes its modal eoloring from feceris, which in turn expresses
an adversative relation to the main clause.

971. laminae: uereor occasionally in early Latin, and once in
Cicero's Letters‚ takes a genitive aiter the analogy oi the gen. with
piper, etc. Translate show respect sor, seel seer because os.

972. quin: following the idea oi prevention implied in what has
preceded.

nouo moder it is noteworthy that the iault oi which Chremes had
been guilty ishere set down as avery unusual thing ior those times.

974. dabo: render, as in And. 683, Heaut. 950, Eun. 212, etc.

974-975. ita. . . incensam. ..utne restinguas: so eeroyrd
reaccensum aot. The ree shows that this ert-clause is an expres-
sion of determination involving the will, and it must accordingly
'be translated by alell aot, instead oi will not. The negative oi
the latter expression would be eon. See App.

976. malum: tlte misclies! serving also as the antecedent oi
quod. This verse is identieal with Plaut. Most. 656.

duint: see note on 123.

677. tantm adiectum aeae: ior the use oi the int with -ee,
