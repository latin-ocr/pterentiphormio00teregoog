DIDASCALIA.

Tenen short notices, giving information regarding the author oi
the play, the date oi its productim, the success attending it, and
other details, were known as διδασκαλίαι, didascalice. Th0y were
first systematically prepared by Alexandrino scholare, from whose
example the Roman grammarians, efter the middle oi the second
century na, adopted the eustom also ior Latin dramas. The most
important oi these grammarians was M. Terentius Varro (de actis
scaenicis lib. III.; see Introd, p. xxvi i). Their works formed the
source oi the didascalice for the plays oi Terence, though it was
probably the grammarians oi the Augustan age who first inserted
them in the Mas. '

Ludis Romanis: these gemes, celebrated in September in honor
oi Jupiter and lasting‚ in the time oi Terence, about ten days, were
established in remote antiquity, doubtless tc commemorate some
Roman victory—according to Cicero, that over the Latine at Lake
Regillus. They were the oldest and most important oi all the Ro-
man gemes. Gladiatorial combam, repedancing, and theatrica]
performances formed the principal features.

aedilibus curulibus: the magistrates to whom was intrusted
the management oi the public gemes.

egit: crocata oet. See Introd, p. xxx.

L. Ambiulus Turpio: a popular actor and theatrical manager‚
who brought out all the plays of Terence. Cicero, de sen. 48,
makes Cato referto him as follows: Ut Turpione Ambitio magis
delectatur qai ia prima cauea spectat, delectetur tamea etiam qui
ia altimo, etc. Since Cicero represents thie dialogue aa having
taken place in 150 rac, it seems probable that he was still active
at that date.

Ιι. Atilius is known to ue only iram the didascalice to the plays
oi Terence. Tor the spelling Atilius, sce App.
