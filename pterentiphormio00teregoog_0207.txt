cantor: tf we may believe Livy (t, 2), the matisc (see Introd,
p. xxxviii) were, at least sometimes, sung not by the actor, but by
someone called the cantor, the actor merely accompanying the song
with appropriate gestures. It was this scotor, apparently, who
came iorward at the end oi the play and selred the audienoe ior
plaudite oi approval. As he was the last to speak, the Mes. of Ter-
ence designate the cantor by Ï‰.

uos nalete et plaudite: some such address to the audience
was customary at the close oi all Roman plays. In Plautus this
address is commonly somewhat elaborate, but in Terence it is sim-
pliiied to the words before us or, in the Andria, the Hecyra, and the
Adelphoe, to the single word plaudite.
