sentence or verse are the beginning (except ior the subiect, when this
does not precede an introductcry particle) and the end (except ior
the verb). Emphatic ideas tend to find utterance first, but special
effecte are often produced by throwing an emphatic word or phrase
, to the end, ior the mind to dwell upon. In general, it may bs said
that an unusual arrangement oi words (ap. reversed order, wide
separation oi words belonging together, juxtaposition ci those con-

trasted, etc.) attracts special attention to such as arc cut ci their
normal position, and thus makes them emphatic. A shifting oi
words in the middle oi a sentence is less noticcable, and so
produces less emphasis. Freedom oi position is limited, ior pur-
poses oi emphasis, only by the necessity oi avoiding obscurity, or
an overburdening oi the mind. For the normal order oi words
in a Latin sentence, see A. t G. 343; B. tis-850, G. 674;
