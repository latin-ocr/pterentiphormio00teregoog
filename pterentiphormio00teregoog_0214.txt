1111111011. 159

131. Some editors, among them Dziatzko‚ punctuate with a colon

aiter 0011100001 and a comma after commodum.

156. The Mss. have 001 01101 istuc, and conscius ais at the end
01 the verse. Bentley dropped the cst and was followed by editors
until Schlee (dc versuum 111 canticis Το1001100100001000110110,1879)
01000111010111111010091100 used merely as an expression oi sur-
prise, qut'd 101110 est? as a real question, thus vindicating the reading
01 the Mss. in the present passage. The interpolation oi st's at the
end is due to a misunderstanding oi the 00110010ιο (1.0. conadu’s ior
0011110100 es) and the consequent desire to complete the clause.
Dniatzko‚ while retaining cat, expresses the view, “ dass auch quid
istuc? der Ausdruclr der verwundemng hier nicht genade unange·
mossen wtre.” How, then, would he explain Antipho's reply?

170. For istaec, etc, see Neue, Formenlehre, 3d ed. by Wagener
(1892), II, pp. 398 ff. Fr. Schmidt, Quaest. de pron. dem. ior. Plaut.
(1875), p. 80 1., 11100 10 show that Terence, as well as Plautus, uses
only 101000, never istu, in neut. plur, but see Ad. 185 and 677.

175. reticere 00 umorem amittere: the Mss. have retinere umore
amittere. Goldbacher, Wiener Studien, VII (1885), p. 162, seems
to me to make out a strong case in 10101 01 the reading I have
adopted. Dziatzko reads retinere amorem 00 mittar& but this
disturbs the parallelism between these infinitives and the amittendi
1100 retinendi 111 the next verse.

193. Mthly (Bldtter iiir das bey. Gymnasialwesen, 24 [1888],
puts 1.) arbitrarily changes nescio to 1010010.

199. Cod. A (first hand) has 01 patruum tuom, which reading is
preferred by C. Sydow, De fide libr. Ter. 010, p. 84, and by Hauler
(Wiener Studien, IV [1882], p. 3221), who support this reading
by Plaut. Trim 111.

215. scd hic quis 001 seem: Dziatzlro reads scd puis hic, 010, 10-
jecting, with Seyffert (Stud. Plaut, Berlin, 1874) the reading 01 A.
111010 preferred to follow A 101 the following reasons: (1) In the
matter 01 the relative position oi words, this Ms. is overwhelm-
ingly superior to the best 01 the other Mss. See Pease, 011 the
Relative Value oi the Mss. 01 Terence (Transactions oi the Am.
Phil. Assoc. ior 1887, p. 33) ; (2) Thisis a case where the scribes
oi the 0111011100, who show a constant tendency to iamper with
the order 01 words, would be sure 10 invert the order, to make it
