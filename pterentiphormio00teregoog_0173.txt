etlam tn hinc abis: do roo llaec 11101 leave me to sa'ce tlte

pretation, is of very differem character. It ia introduced by
aoa, and the ta is very emphatic, as may be seen again in the

is intended.

condition, but it dritted away from this meaning, and carne to be
used with an indicative apodosis, referring to present time. (li. 540,
parumne eu guod . . . succenset aenea, al instigemur etiam? etc.
