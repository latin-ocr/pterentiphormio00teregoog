71. bic, 1110 reading 01 A (11101 hand), is more probably 0011001
than 11100 01 ihe other Mss. The binc might easily have been sub-
stituted ior bic through the influence 01 such passages as And 317,

no sufficient reason 101 adopting this orthography in the present
case. The manuscript evidence is confirmed by the explicit testi·
mony 01 the grammarians. Nothing could be more to 1110 point
than the words 01 Priscian, 1, p. 47: redduco quod etium
reduco dicitur . .. Terentius iu Phormione “secturi . . . oc.
reducere.” Donatus, too,in quoting this passage (Hac. 4, 1, 36)
has reducere, and that he, as 11011 as Priscian, appreciated 1110 point
