of an adj. is not used substantively in Terence, except when used
‘⁸ in generallem Sinne.’‘ Vero is frequently used substantively in
both Plautus and Terence, and it seems safer to admit exceptione
to a rule involving fine distinctions, than to change the Mss. to
make them conform to it in every case.

502. neque: Dziatzko adopts Wagner's coniectura and writes
atque, but the reading of the Mss. seems tenable, ifwe understand
olio as explained in my uotc: “ To thiale that thia trouble, is tt
hod to conce ct cll, did cot conte ct o time when Antipho was hoo-
c'cp less trouble os circumcisor lte might devote himself more
ecclcsieely to helpido mc‚” Isee no real objection to this inter-
pretation in the “fortunatissimc Antipho ’' of vs. 504. Phaedria
is startled into this exclamation by the sudden appearance of Anti- .
pho, and his only thought for the instant was that Antipho's lot
was, after all, happy indeed as compared with his own, for he at

507. Dziatzlro follows Bentley in rejecting this verse. ·

519. In his stereotyped edition of all the plays, Dziatzlro gives
the words Di tibi . . . daictto Geta, but in his separate edition
of the Phormio he follows A and Umpfenbaoh in giving them to

567. Chremes .· there can hardly be any doubt that Terence used
two forms of the vocative (-c and cs) in such Greek words, just as
he used two forms of the accusative, but it is in many passages
extremely difficult to determine the better reading. See, in addi-
tion to the authorities cited by Dziatzko, Engelbrecht's review of
Dziatzlro’s edition in the Berliner Phil. Wochenschrift V,
p. 326 ff, Minton Warren's review of Hauler’s Terentiana in the
Am. Journ. Phil. III. (1882), p. 483, Hauler’s Paldcgraphisches zum
Bembinus des Terenz in Wiener Studien, Xl (1889), p. 286, and
the same writer’s Textkritisches zum Bembinus des Terenz iu
Wiener Studien, XII (1890), p. 242.
