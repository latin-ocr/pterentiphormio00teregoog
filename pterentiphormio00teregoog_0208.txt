APPENDIX.

-οοο-

As intimated in the preface, this appendix is devoted almost
exclusively to the citation of authorities for statements made in the
notes, where such citation seems desirable, and to the defense of
readings, adopted in this edition, which are at variance with the
text oi Dniatzko.

As the testimony oi the manuscripts is frequently referred to
below, it will be well to keep in mind the relative importance of
the different familias. The following diagram is offered with a
view to making clearer the relationship between them.
