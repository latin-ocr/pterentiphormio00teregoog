XX INTRODUCTION.

friends oi Terence, above referred to, aided him in his literary
work, anderen that large parts oi his dramas were written by
them. This report originated with those who were jealons oi
Terence’s success, and it probably gained credeoce from the
noncommittal words oi the poet when referring to that re·
port. It can hardly be doubted that Terence actually did
receive much encouragement in various ways from hie noble
friends and even profited at times by their advice, bnt further
than this there is no good reason to suppose that he was de-
pendent upon them. His language, to be sure, is that oi the
highest and most cultured society oi his time, but this is to be
looked upon as a result oi his constant intercourse with that
society, and need not cast any suspicion upon the authenticity

The literary tendeney oi the times, as well as his own inclina

and, as the caller was meanly dressed, he was given a seat on a
bench near the conch on which the great author was reclining,
and was then given permission to read what he had written.
After the first iew verses had been read, Caecilius was so capti· ›
vated hythe young man’s talenta that he invited him to a place
beside him upon the couch. He then listened attentively and
with unbounded admiration to the remainder oi the play.¹

1 Hieronymus, ln Euseb. Chron. Olymp. CL 2, places the death oi
Caecilius in the year aiter that oi Ennius (who died 169 aa). But
the morra was not produced till 166 rac. The question arises whether
the date oi Caecilins’ death, as given ln Hieronymus, rests upon an
