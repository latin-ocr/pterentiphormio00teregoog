11 16 661 16 be wondered at that the earliest writers, iu adapt-
ing the productione oi foreign genius 16 Roman ears, should
give them something oi 6 native character, and we accordingly

error, or whether the first productiori 61 166 Andria, 16 spite 61 166
praise acoorded it by caecilius, was poetponed 166 several years.
Dziatzko agrees with Ritschl in the supposition that, in Hieronymus’
words: mortuas est .(anciiiue) canopea moriem Ennii et iacta Ianic
aiam . . . ,anumeral has fallen 661 61166 Ennii, and that it should
read anno . . . 111 (tertio), or, ae Dziatzko thinks more probable, 1111
or IV (quarto).

tion accordingly assigue the Heaut. to the second place, the 1166. 16
166 third, etc.

² Second uneuccessiul presentation.

called the play adelphi, and that the ending -oe is due entirely 16 166

composer 61 166 didascalia. But Η6661. 16615, Heauton timoru-
menon, and Phorm. Prol. 25, Epidicazomenon, show 1661, 16 166

111166 61 fabulae palliatae 61166 time 61 Terence, not only the Greek
names, but aleo the Greek terminatione, were retained eo 166 66
possible, except where 6 Greek word had been naturalized in Latin
—as 16 166 case, 166 instance, with 1166661166.

⁴ Third and successful presentation.
