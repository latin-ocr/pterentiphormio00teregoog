must marry her. The marriage accordingly takes place be·

fore the arrival of the father-‚1 They araboth supported by

the slave Geta, whom Demipho, the father oi Antipho, at his
¹ departure, has left in charge oi his son, but who, as the slaves
in Greek comcdy usually do, humors his young master and
seeks at all times to shield him, even at the risk oi getting
a drubbing himself, against the consequences of his misdeeds.
They are also aided by Phaedria, the cousin of Antipho. Phae-
dria’s father, Chremes, brother of Demipho, is also absent on a
Journey. In the mean time, Phaedria falls in love with amusic
girl, the slave oi a procurer, but has not sufficient money to pur·
cbase her. ⁴

At this point the play opens, just as the two old gentlemen
return from their y'ourney. The marriage of Antipho, haring
already taken place before the opening of the play, the ques
tion now is: How is the news to be broken to the father, and
how is he to be reconcilcd to what has taken place? Phaedria
at the same time is reduced to straits by the action ofv the pro·
curer, who, tired ol waiting for Phaedria to purchase the music
girl, proposes now to sell her to another, to be taken to foreign
lands, unless the money be straightway forthcoming. This
trouble of Phaedria is very effectively interwoven with the
main thread of the play. Phormio, while in reality secking to
assare to Antipho the continued eny'oyment oi his present rc·
lations with Phanium, manages to procare from Demipho the
money needed by Phaedria, on the pretext of wishing to bring
about a dissolution of those relations.

The disentanglement oi the complicatione is brought about,
as is usually the case in fabulae palliatae, purely by external
occurrences. It is no change oi disposition on the part of

¹111 an essay entitled “Le proces du Phormion” (Anu. de l'assoc.
p. l'enc. d. et gr. en. Franco XII. 48-62), R. Lallier shows that the in·
trigue devised by Phormio and his whole behawcr, when one considers
the condition ol things in Atheus at the time. contain nothing ln the

least improbable.
