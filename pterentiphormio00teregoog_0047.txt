(2) In a monosyllabic word (or one that has become such
by elision) preceded by a short monosyllable (or a word which
bas become such by elision) 3

(3) Iu the first syllable of a word of two or more syllables
preceded by a short monosyllable (or a word that has become
such by elisiou);

(4) ln the second syllable of a polysyllabio word beginning
with a short syllable. ,

In the cases under (3) aud (4), the rule holds only for syllables
“ lony by position‚” but having a short vowel.

Another effect oi the metrical aocent is frequently seen in
cases where monosyllabis words ending in a long vowel, or
in m, instead oi being elidad before aiollowing vowel, or lr,
receive the ictus and are treated as short syllables (ay. Phorm.
27 qui apen 419 od aqam 808 (l) quo'm eqo).

4. Synthesis and Hiatus.

Two¹ vowcls coming together within a word, but not forming
a diphthong, regularly remain separate in verse, y'ust as in
ordinary speech. Such vowels are, however, blended together
(synaloepha, 01· synthesis) when they belong to originally
distinct words (ey. Phorm. 4 arrreilm 668 proinde), unless the
final vowel oi the first word is long and has the ictus, when, iu
accordance with the rule just given above, it is retained in a
short form (ey. Phorm. 425 prdlihebo). Synizesis may occur
also in words like uin ( = aisne), mtam, cle-us, rae-us, eTrm, furcae, ,
cu'rr‘rs, limus, dr‘r‘elius, dms, nescio, reicere, deeralus, quma, dum,
etc. ln many cases, however, it is impossible to decide whether
there is synizesia, or a shorteniug oi the final syllable of an
iambic word. In words oi which the lauguage has both a full
and a contracted form (ey. ellit and nil, prehendo and prendo
etc.) the manuscripts 01 Terence have, almost without excep-
tion, the full form, even where the melre requires the short

form.
