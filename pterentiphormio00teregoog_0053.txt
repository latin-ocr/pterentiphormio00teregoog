Demipho that brings about his reconciliation to the marriage,
but this is effected rather by discovery 01 110 identity 01 the

objectionable girl with one whom all were ready to receive with
open arms. Phanium, the young wife‚is found 10 be the
daughter oi Chremes by a secret marriage, which he has entered
into in Lemnos, under a fictitious name assumed sor tear of dis·
covery by his Athenian wite. She is thus found to be in re
ality, what the intriguers merely pretended she was before the
court, te. one to whom Demipho and Antipho were next 01110.
She is, in fact, the very person who had long been selected
both by Demipho and Chremes 00 0 wife for Antipho. By
disclusure 01110 secret to Nausistrata, the Athenian wife cf
Chremes, Phormio, who had, by a happy chance, learned of
the whole affair, is enabled 01 110 end 10 secure to Phaedria
also the possession 01 his sweetheart.

The play is characterized bya careiul interweaving of the
various parts, aud the characters are clearly drawn and con-
sistently maintained throughout. The two young men, in the
nature 01 thiu gs, seem very much alilre. On the contrary, the
two old men are strongly individualized: Demipho is irritable,
impetuous, determined; Chremes, irresolute, timid, submissive.
Nausistrata is well aware oi this differente and bestows upon
Demipho, who, by the way, is a widower (see νο. 422 1.), respect
as marked 00 10 110 contempt with which she treats her husband
(νο. 719 ff, 784 ff, 1011 ff, 1031 a). The relation 01 Chremes
10 his wife is made all the more unfortunate for him by the
10011101 all the property belongs to her (cf. vs. 586 1., 680, 788
ff, 940).

To oue feature oi the play, critias may, perhaps, 1010 excep-
tion. Why does not Phormio, aiter having sufficiently bantered
the old men and compelled them, by threatening 10 tell N 00-
sistrata oi the secret marriage, to give up all claim to the
money already paid him, -why does not Phormio content him·
0011 with this result? Why does he, by carrying out his threat,
again set at 01010 what he has won? He must indeed have
ioreseeu that he would not be able to carry out his plan without
