INTRODUGTION.

The Early Greek comedy.

The word comedy (comptis) means literally the “song of
revehy” (κῶμος, ᾄδειν), or possibly the song oi the κώμη,
te, “village song.” The Dorians, and especially one Suse-
rion (about 580 aa), seem to deserve the credit oi having
first dramatized the rude dialogue, in which comedy had its
origin, and given it something like aliterary form. The prin·
cipal representative, however, of that branch oi literature, be-
fore it reached the perfection it attained during the period
oi Pericles, was Epicharmus, a contemporary oi Aeschylus.
He was born on the island oi Cos about 540 rac, and from
there, at the age oi three months, was taken to Megara in
Sicily, where he spent most oi his iiie and where he died
about 450 rac. But comedy did not reach any high degree
oi development until it was taken up hythe master artiets
oi Athens in the time of Pericles. The conditione of Greek
liie at this period were peculiarly favorable ior developing this
branoh of writing. The intellectual activity and the highly
developed political life of the times worked together to bring
it rapidly to a position oi great importance and influenoe.
cratinus, Eupolis, Phrynichus, are the first to be men·
tioned as writers oi the old Attio comedy, but these are oi
little importance in comparison with Aristophanes (fl. 427-388
iac), who soon appeared upon the soene and became by iar the
most important representative oi this school. It lies, oi course,
in the nature of comedy to depict the gay and humorous3 and
at the time with which we are now dealing, the keen and ab
sorbing interest taken by all classes in politice gave direction
to the popular comedy. Publio men and affairs formed its
materiai. These were subjected to that keen wit with which
tho Atheniens, above all others, were endowed. With refer-
ence to form and technique, it was natural enough that comedy
should ior the most part be modeled aiter the outlines marked
out by writers oi tragedy, which already existed in a highly
developed form. From tragedy, too, comedy largely drew its
material ior parodies.
