these veram Fescennina, aform oi representation arose ior which
preparation was made beforehand and less was entrusted to
improvisation. To add to the interest oi the entertainment,
the verses were now accompanied by music and dancing, and
the whole performance in this improved form took the name
oi flatura. These performances, if we may accept the com·
mon view regarding the meaning oi the term saturae,1 seem to
have been devoid oi any connected plot, but they demanded
a certain amount ci care and skill on the part ci the per·
formers, and accordingly a class oi people began to devote
special attention to acting as a profession. We must oi course
look upon these saturae (oi which the contente were oi a purely
local character, and the structure even yet not artistic) as
entirely different irom the Greek comedies as iar as their
contente and their structure were concerned. A nearer ap
proach to dramatic iorm was made in the fabulae Atellanae,
sccalled because they are said to have originated in the Cam·
paniau town oi Atella. The fabulae Atellanae were broad farces
in which figured stock characters analogous to the clown, pan·
taioon and harlequin oi a modern pantomime. Rude as all
these performances were, they nevertheless awakened in the Ro-
man public an interest in dramatic representatione. Under
favorable circumstances they might have developed into an
artistic drama that would have been truly Roman in thought
and feeling.

But there now appeared on the scene an influence that was
destined to dominata the whole course oi Roman literature.
After the war with Pyrrhus, the Romans came into closer con-
tact with the Greek cities oi southern Italy and Sicily, and had
their attention called to the creations oi Greek genius. They

designation oi an assumed Roman parallel te the old Greek comedy.
