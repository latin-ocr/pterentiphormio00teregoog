ham ln N. Jahrb. Sup. Bd. 14, p. 207) to apud forum, for the
alleged reason that od forum is used “nur bei Verben der Be·
wegung.” But ad in the sense of apud, ct, near, is common

enough at all periods; see &ebs-schmalz, Antibarbarus‚ p. 76, with ’

the authorities there cited. Τ110 phrase esse ad sorum occurs in
Plaut. Most. 829, and ad soram is the unanimous reading of the
Mss. in the present passage. Furthermore, apud sorum cannot
stand here for metrical reasons. The common rule (given, ior in·
0101100, by Dziatzko‚ p. 26, by Hayley, p. 10), that the proceleus-
matic is allowed by Terence in every ioot of an iambic aenulfus
except the last, has no basis so far as the fifth ioot is concerned.

611. compluria: Dziatzko follows the second hand of A in
giving this word to Chremes, bnt the punctuation I have adopted
makes it possible to follow the reading of the Mse. For the form
complanta, see Donatus on the passage; Charis. p. 125 (Keil);
Prisc. 1, pp. 3000111315, Neue-wagener, Formenlehre, 11, p.

Sandford's note in the Classical Review‚ III (1889).

Dziatzko‚ seems quite unnecessary. See note.

884. 111ον0, with Dziatzko‚ followed A in making this the hegin-
ning of a new scene, bnt I do not feel sure that such a division is
correct. The illustrated Mss. make no division here, and there
can be little doubt that the picturas of the characters placed at the
beginning of each scene in these Mss. are taken from a Ms. of the
best period (Leo, Rh. Mus, XXXVIII ; Schlee‚ Scholia Terentiana
[1893]‚ p. 5). While it does not necessarily follow that these

pictures are safer guidae, in the matter cf scene-division (Schlee‚
Scholia Terentiana, p. 6) than the superscriptionem A, their testi·
mony should have considerable weight. Umpfenbach and Dziatzlro
both accept their evidence at 441 against A, which makes no division

at that point. A somewhat serious obiection 10 making 884 the
beginning of a new scene is that it compels us to recognize the use
