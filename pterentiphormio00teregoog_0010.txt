Triones the Phormio is admittedly one of the hest of
the plays oi Terence, no annotated edition of it suitable
for eollege use has yet been published in Amerina. This
faet alone makes it unneeessary, I hope, to apologize

While the text of this editionis, in general, based
upon that of Dziatzho‚ I have often ventured to deviate
from his readings, prompted sometimes by suggestions

that have been made since his edition was published,

manuscripts, unless demonstrably false, is entitled to

all important editions of the play and have taken
occasional notes from that of Sloman and less frequently
from that of Bond and Walpole.

grateful appreciation of his oourtesy in giving me per-
