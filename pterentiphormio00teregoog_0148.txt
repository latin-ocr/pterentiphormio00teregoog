212. uerbo ε dat, not ahl.

parit the only instance in Terence oi the dat. oi a neuter adj.
used substantively. The preceding uerbo and the tendenoy to allit-
eration facilitate such a use here. The substantive use 01 adjectivcs
is rare in Terence, and does not occur at all in the nom. neut. Itis
chiefly iound in those expressing abstract conceptione (in which

case even the gen. is found, ep. 637), and in neuters used to denote
locutive relations (cp. ic proxumo).

questions, when impetiently celred, are often ielt as equivalent to
commende. In this way quio came to be associated vvith the idea
