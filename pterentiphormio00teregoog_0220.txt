Arrnunrx. 165

974-975. Por a discussion oi Brix’s claim that ae is sometimes
used in consecutive clauses, see Am. J ourn. Phil., Vol. XV. (Latin
Prohibitive, Part. IL).

1004. hear quid ais: Daiatzko assigna these words to Nausi-
strata, against the Mss.‚ on the ground that this question seems
inappropriate ior Demipho aiter vs. 941 i. It must he remembered,
however, that hcm and quid ais? often express mere indignation,
and do not necessarily Imply surprlse. The fact that Nausistrata
is now present and will hear what Phormio is about to say, sui·
ficiently accounts lor Demipho's exclamation.

1028. suso tall sit arcuatas: the oldest aud best Ms. (A) has ,

this reading; the later Mss. hare saco tali eum mactatum, though
in D this was not the orIginal reading. The latter reading is less
probabis, ior the further reason that it would necessitate making
hic long, whereas it is regularly short in Terence (see note on 266).
See Dziatzlro, Rh. Mus. XXXIX (1884), p. 341.

1028-1029. Dziatzlro’s claim that a verse has fallen out between
these two verses does not seem to me to be justified. See stege
directions ior the line and note on the passage.

1051. On the use oi cue ct in Terence, see my papst on The
Oopulative Conjunctions in the Inscriptions of the Republic, in
Terence and in Cato, 5 28, Am. Journ. Phil, Vol. VIII.

1054. Dziatzlro, following BCDP, assigna the words eamus iutro
hinc to Demipho. I follow A in giving them to Phormio. The
fact that Phormio le to go iu another direction a moment later
makes no difficulty. After he has uttered the words, Nausistrata's
question prompts hlm to change hIs purpose aud hurry oli in search
oi Phaedria.
