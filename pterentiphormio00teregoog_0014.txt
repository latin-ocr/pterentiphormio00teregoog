The Origln ot the Greek Drama.

Tua Greek drama had its origin in the village festival that
was wont to be held each year, at the vintage time, in honor
of Dionysus, the god oswine, the bringer ο1 good cheen Dio-
nysus, in the popular fancy, was supposed to have wandered
through the world, accompanied by a baud of satyra and
nymphs, spreading his worship among men, encountering
countless dangers and hardships in his progress, now falling
into the hands of pirates and thrown into chains, now aiding
the gods in their war with the giants, now being torn to
pieces at the command ot the jealous Hera, but springing up
again with new life, and finally triumphing over all obsta·
cles and bringing J'oy and blessing to all mankind. It was
customary among the country tollr, when they gathered in the
grapes‚ to celebrate the adventures ο1 this god, whose bounty
they were about to enjoy. One member ο1 the company
would impersonate the god himself, aud the others would aot
the part ο1 his attendant satyrs3 and the story ο1 the god's
adventures would thus, in a rude and impromptu fashion, be
enacted. Some parts of this story were bright and gay,
while others were sad and tragic; audit was in these rude
attempta to represent its different aspecta that both comedy
and tragedy had their origin. Tragedy, however, was earlier “

than comedy in reaching maturity.
